Sweet!!
i loaded knoppix on a "broken" machine,
mounted over to the Batcave folder(batman folder,or Whatever directory i choose),
and now copied the important data over!!

Remote Desktop Connection DOES work from Knoppix CD!!  Use the GUI. (not the vncviewer from shell prompt)

You know how you cant Not share a Folder unless its under YOUR home directory?? Well, make a symbolic link of the desired forlder, and put THAt in your hom
e folder. Then Share the Link!!  = ]

Justin Notes:

Copy Data CD:
dd if=/dev/hdc of=/home/batcave/crunch/sentitem.iso
(dd if=/dev/cdrecorder of=/home/batcave/iso/test.iso)
(eject /dev/cdrecorder)

(i used K3b for the next step which ran the cmd for me)
/usr/bin/cdrecord -v gracetime=2 dev=0,0,0 speed=4 driveropts=burnfree -eject -dao -data /home/batcave/crunch/sentitem.iso

Mount a Jumpdrive (and maybe a camera etc, as long as linux already detects it)

mount /dev/sda1 suse9/

Tada! Thats it!

switch to init 3, then run this command to fix your
video:

This command can also give you clues on your video
hardware:
# lspci -v |grep VGA
(Also, sometimes its better to use the generic VESA setting at the correct resolution for you LCD
instead.)

Good command for fixing you Sound (if you lucky)

Graceful BoOt OFF:

Argh, this *only* be used as the absolutely last resort if every other way
of terminating a process has failed. It doesn't leave the killed
process any chance at all to clean up properly behind it, and so
maximizes your chance for data loss, temporary files left lying
around, locked or damaged resources, annoyed users and general unpleasantness:
 1. As root
 2. su their-username
 3. kill -9 -1

 Howto copy Bootable USB Flash drive (image) to a blank USB drive:

First, Pop in the Customized Flash Drive, 
Then, find out which device is your USB by --> sudo fdisk -l  (in this example, it's sdb)

then run:
sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=usb-image.iso

Then swap out the Customized Flash drive with a Blank one (same size) and run:
sudo dd if=usb-image.iso of=/dev/sdb

Voila!
~Hal Pomeranz, Deer Run Associates

Question, if my original USB is 2GB, and I would like the .iso to be replicated/created on a 4GB drive, is it possible?
-Hypothetically Yes, If you have a larger USB drive, you can simply create a correctly sized partition on that drive and then copy your image to just that partition. thus:
sudo dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=usb-Just-Partition.iso
sudo dd if=usb-Just-Partition.iso of=/dev/sdb1

(untested, but good luck)

HULU & Youtube won't play. Says i need Adobe Flashplayer:

the task is to put the "libflashplayer.so" in the "/usr/lib/firefox-3.0.10/plugins/" folder.
So go to :
http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/

download "Adobe Flash Player version 10.0.32.18"
download the "tar.gz" file type choice.

-Close FireFox.

Right-click the file, extract the file. this will create a file called "libflashplayer.so".

As ROOT, now copy this file to the firefox plugins folder:

cp libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/firefox-3.0.10/plugins/libflashplayer.so

i then ran this just in case:
chmod 777 libflashplayer.so

reopen firefox and now youtube flash should work!!

How to setup a basic iptable traffic redirect:

(Run this to see whats running presently)
suse11:/home/batman11 # iptables -t nat -L -v

(then, turn on ip-forwarding)
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward


(Redirect all incoming 3389 traffic from 154 to 126):
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 0/0 -p tcp --dport 3389 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.126:3389
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -m tcp -d 192.168.1.126 --dport 3389 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.1.154


(Redirect all incoming 443 traffic from 154 to 126):
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 0/0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.126:443 
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -m tcp -d 192.168.1.126 --dport 443 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.1.154

(Run this again to make sure it took):
suse11:/home/batman11 # iptables -t nat -L -v

"OPHCRACK on Bootable USB:  No Tables Found!"

---------------
Dummy's Solution:
Just put a copy of the '\tables'subdirectory on the Root of the Usb-drive ahead of time.
(yeah.. ridiculous... i know)


----------------------
Higher-Intellect Solution:


Boot from USB.
launch terminal:

su
(root is pw)

mkdir /mnt/jj

fdisk -l

(this will display a list of drives and partitions. it will show your harddrive (sda1, 2, etc). We don't want those.
We want the USB drive (which on my computer is sdc1)

mount -t iso9660 /mnt/sdc1/multiboot/isos/ophcrack36.iso /mnt/jj/ -o loop

~so the Trick is to loop-mount the very ISO that Boots the Slitaz-Linux-instance in the first place.
By design, the ISO has the "tables" directory at the root of the ISO image.
Thus, when the ISO is mounted, the "tables" directory is now RIGHT at the root of /mnt/jj...
and THATS why the tables are now found.

now you can run:  ./launch.sh
(it's going to check inside each subfolder in /mnt/* and look for a folder called "tables". Thats why it works :)

------



***********************
Bonus:
Howto add other Hash tables into the Instance:

For bootable USB: Use the "dummies" solution.

For a DVD solution:
do a 'DATA' disc burn. The dvd will only have 1 object: a folder called "tables".
inside this folder will be all the other HASH table subfolders.
So, BOOT from the USB drive (and usual)... and hopefully you can access the stronger Hash-tables off the DVD :]

To create an All-in-One bootable DVD:
refer to the imgburn-boot-hack on batcave\wintoys dir.

--

outdated Bonus:
download the other TABLES and create a soft-link to point them inside /mnt/kk/
it "should" work...
ln -sf /mnt/sdc1/whereever /mnt/kk/tables  (or somthing close)
