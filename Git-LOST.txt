GRRRRRRRRRR!!!
So... i think i finally got that crap!!!!


Let's Go:

First, youâ€™ll need to sign up for an account on *GitHub.com*. Itâ€™s as simple as...

You might as well keep going! do the the section --> "Creating Your Online Repository" 

- 2	
From your remote box;
Generate SSH key using ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your_email@foo.com".

Copy the output of cat id_rsa.pub
Paste the above copied output into your Github profile -> Settings -> SSH and GPG Keys -> Add new SSH key.

- 2b
make sure you have named the "public key" and "private key" files properly; 
precisely ----> "id_rsa" and "id_rsa.pub"  <----- 

Restart your terminal ( bash supported) and try to clone again

if you have the write access to the repo, you should be good to go after these changes.
Talking from experience (after spending an hour), 
I could not find any info on any forum that stated that we have to explicitly keep the name of the private and public file as mentioned above.
Happy coding!
